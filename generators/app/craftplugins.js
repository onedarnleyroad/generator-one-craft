/**
 * CRAFT PLUGINS
 * ------------------
 *
 * Plugins for craft.  This is where you list all the plugins to be used in the yeoman app.
 * The user will be prompted, unless you configure it to be essential, whatever they leave
 * checked will be installed into the plugins directory as you'd expect.
 *
 * I'd like to find a way to simply add the repo and just do 'latest'.
 * Perhaps we just fetch the master branch?
 *
 * EG you could supply
 *
 * type: githubrepo
 * repo: johndwells/craft.minimee
 *
 * And then the app could build the zip url:
 *
 * https://github.com/johndwells/craft.minimee/archive/master.zip
 *
 * As it is there seems to be no simple way to fetch the latest *release* i.e.
 *
 * https://github.com/johndwells/craft.minimee/releases/tag/v0.9.6
 *
 * But maybe we want to control release versions anyway

		essential: bool // if true then we won't ask people, it just gets installed regardless - useful if your templates have dependencies
		srcFolder: string | false // if a string, then it will only copy that from that folder in the zip file.  Otherwise it'll just copy anything
		destFolder: string | false // if string, then it will put everything into this folder, in the plugins directory.  Useful when the repo has the plugin at root
