     * For modern browsers
     * 1. The space content is one way to avoid an Opera bug when the
     *    contenteditable attribute is included anywhere else in the document.
     *    Otherwise it causes space to appear at the top and bottom of elements
     *    that are clearfixed.
     * 2. The use of `table` rather than `block` is only necessary if using
     *    `:before` to contain the top-margins of child elements.
     * 3. Fixes Opera/contenteditable bug:
