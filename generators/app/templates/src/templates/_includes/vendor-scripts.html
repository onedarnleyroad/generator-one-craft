    This snippet will dynamically update from the gulp tasks wiredep and useref.
    Even though we might bundle this inside minimee, we still need to apply gulp-inject and
    main-bower-files to generate a bundled vendor script from our bower scripts that Craft
    can actually access (i.e. to move things out of the bower_components directory)

    TL;DR:
    As such the HTML comments are important the way they are as they are parsed by the gulpfile!
